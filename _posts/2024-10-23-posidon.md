### POSEIDON: A New Direction in Managing MEC Networks

As the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and connected devices continue to grow, network infrastructures must keep up with the increasing demand for data processing and real-time responses. Multi-access edge computing (MEC) networks are designed to address this by moving computing resources closer to the "edge" of the network, allowing faster response times. However, managing MEC networks—especially as they scale—comes with significant challenges.

**POSEIDON** is a new framework that combines **Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)** with traditional optimization techniques to improve how we manage these networks. While still in the early stages, POSEIDON offers a fresh approach to handling some of the key issues facing MEC networks today.

#### The Complexity of MEC Network Management

MEC networks help reduce delays by processing data near the user, avoiding the need to send it to distant cloud servers. This makes them ideal for real-time applications like traffic monitoring, smart home devices, and video streaming. However, as more devices come online, the demands on MEC networks grow, creating new challenges:

1. **Dynamic Workloads**: The number of tasks or requests in a MEC network can vary greatly. For example, a traffic monitoring system may handle a few requests late at night but experience a massive spike during rush hour.
2. **Function Placement**: Deciding which nodes (computers) should run specific applications or functions is key to maintaining efficient operations. The system must decide how many nodes to use and where to place these functions based on real-time demand.
3. **Routing Policy**: When one node becomes overloaded, the system needs to reroute some tasks to other, less busy nodes to balance the workload.

Traditional frameworks like **NEPTUNE** have provided solutions to these problems using **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)**. NEPTUNE optimizes two main tasks: **function placement** and **routing policy**. It divides the network into small groups of nodes, called communities, and optimizes how tasks are distributed across them.

However, **NEPTUNE's** reliance on MILP presents a significant limitation: **slow decision times**. As the number of nodes and applications increases, the time it takes for NEPTUNE to make decisions grows exponentially. This makes it less practical for real-time environments where workloads can change instantly.

#### How POSEIDON Offers a New Approach

POSEIDON aims to address these limitations by integrating **Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL)** with MILP. In this framework, Deep RL is used to speed up decision-making for function placement, while MILP is applied afterward to fine-tune routing policies.

Using the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm, POSEIDON's Deep RL model learns from past experiences, figuring out which function placements work well in different situations. The model can then quickly make decisions about where to place functions, responding to dynamic workloads in real time. This is particularly useful in fast-changing environments like MEC networks, where rapid adaptation is key.

Once the function placement is decided by the Deep RL model, POSEIDON applies MILP to determine the most efficient routing policy, ensuring that overloaded nodes can offload tasks to other nodes in the network.

This combination of Deep RL and MILP provides a more scalable and responsive system compared to traditional approaches like NEPTUNE.

#### POSEIDON vs. NEPTUNE: Key Differences

While both POSEIDON and NEPTUNE address the same core challenges in MEC network management, POSEIDON's use of Deep RL offers several potential advantages:

- **Faster Decision-Making**: POSEIDON’s Deep RL model can make decisions about function placement in constant time, significantly reducing the time it takes to respond to changing network conditions. This makes it well-suited for real-time applications.
- **Scalability**: As the number of nodes and applications grows, NEPTUNE’s performance declines due to the increasing complexity of MILP-based optimization. POSEIDON’s hybrid approach maintains consistent performance, even as the network scales.
- **Comparable Performance**: Initial tests show that POSEIDON delivers results similar to NEPTUNE in terms of network efficiency and workload distribution. However, POSEIDON achieves this with much faster processing times.

#### A Step Forward, but More Research Ahead

While POSEIDON offers promising improvements in MEC network management, it’s still a developing area of research. The integration of Deep RL with traditional optimization methods is relatively new, and more work is needed to fully explore its potential. For example, understanding the trade-offs between decision speed and accuracy in different types of networks will be important as POSEIDON continues to evolve.

However, the early results are encouraging. POSEIDON has demonstrated the ability to scale more effectively than NEPTUNE, making it an interesting direction for future research in MEC networks.

#### Looking Ahead

As IoT and 5G technologies continue to expand, MEC networks will play an increasingly important role in providing real-time services for smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and other data-driven applications. Managing these networks efficiently is critical, and frameworks like POSEIDON offer new tools for tackling the growing complexity of edge computing.

Researchers and developers interested in exploring this area further can access POSEIDON’s source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/sa4s-serc/poseidon). Although it’s still early days, POSEIDON offers a glimpse into how AI-driven methods could enhance the future of network management.

POSEIDON represents a step toward more flexible and scalable solutions for managing MEC networks, providing a foundation for future developments in this rapidly evolving field.
