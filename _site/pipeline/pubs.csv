Towards Architecting Sustainable MLOps: A Self-Adaptation Approach,"This paper introduces a novel approach employing self-adaptive principles integrated into the MLOps architecture through a MAPE-K loop to bolster MLOps sustainability. By autonomously responding to uncertainties, including data, model dynamics, and environmental variations, our approach aims to address the sustainability concerns of a given MLOps pipeline identified by an architect at design time. Further, we implement the method for a Smart City use case to display the capabilities of our approach.","Hiya Bhatt, Shrikara Arun, Adyansh Kakran, Karthik Vaidhyanathan",https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04572,,,,
Can LLMs Generate Architectural Design Decisions? - An Exploratory Empirical study,"Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) involves the organized handling of information related to architectural decisions and design within a project or organization. An essential artefact of AKM is the Architecture Decision Records (ADR), which documents key design decisions. ADRs are documents that capture decision context, decision made and various aspects related to a design decision, thereby promoting transparency, collaboration, and understanding. Despite their benefits, ADR adoption in software development has been slow due to challenges like time constraints and inconsistent uptake. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) may help bridge this adoption gap by facilitating ADR generation. However, the effectiveness of LLM for ADR generation or understanding is something that has not been explored. To this end, in this work, we perform an exploratory study which aims to investigate the feasibility of using LLM for the generation of ADRs given the decision context. In our exploratory study, we utilize GPT and T5-based models with 0-shot, few-shot, and finetuning approaches to generate the Decision of an ADR given its Context. Our results indicate that in a 0-shot setting, state-of-theart models such as GPT-4 generate relevant and accurate Design Decisions, although they fall short of human-level performance. Additionally, we observe that more cost-effective models like GPT-3.5 can achieve similar outcomes in a few-shot setting, and smaller models such as Flan-T5 can yield comparable results after fine-tuning. To conclude, this exploratory study suggests that LLM can generate Design Decisions, but further research is required to attain human-level generation and establish standardized widespread adoption","Rudra Dhar, Karthik Vaidhyanathan, Vasudeva Varma",https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01709,,,Samples,https://www.allanlab.org/publications/
Leveraging Generative AI for Architecture Knowledge Management,"While documenting Architectural Knowledge (AK) is crucial, it is frequently neglected in many projects, and existing manual tools are underutilized. Although undocumented, Architecture Knowledge (AK) is dispersed across various sources such as source code, documentation, and runtime logs. To address this, automated tools for efficient AK extraction and documentation are essential. Even after generating AK, navigating through vast the Architectural Records can be overwhelming. Building on that, we propose an automated Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) System using Information Extraction and Generative AI, which generates AK from various source for a given system and answers architectural queries with respect to the given system. The development of an efficient Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM) system, which is both effective and userfriendly, entails the resolution of numerous challenges. It requires consolidating diverse AK data sources scattered across code, diagrams, repository commits, and online platforms. The integration of Multimodal AI for AK extraction, incorporation of global AK, and leveraging Generative AI for AK documentation further compounds the problem. Moreover, generating contextually appropriate query responses adds another layer of complexity. To this end, we performed an initial exploratory study on generating Architectural Design Decisions using generative Large Language Models (LLM) in the context of Architecture Decision Records (ADR). Our initial results have been promising indicating the potential impact of GenAI for architectural knowledge management.","Rudra Dhar, Karthik Vaidhyanathan, Vasudeva Varma",,,,,
